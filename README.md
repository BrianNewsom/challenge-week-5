# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

The Tableau tutorials were a little too fast for me, and I was really struggling to learn the software.  It's not quite as intuitive as it seems at first.

## What new knowledge or insight have you gained from this visualization? (6 points)

I discovered how many of the DDOS attacks are coming OUT of the USA, I expected a lot to be coming in but not many out of America.  It was interesting to see the major players in black hat hacking and identify them by type of attack and bandwidth.

My visualization is slightly different from the given one.  I am not sure where this is coming from, as I believe everything is configured correctly.

I could not get the package installed correctly on my linux or windows machnines. I tried troubleshooting and installing packages individually but that wasn't working either.
